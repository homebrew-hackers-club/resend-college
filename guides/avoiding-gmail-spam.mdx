## Authenticate Your Email

Email authentication proves messages are truly from you and haven’t been forged. SPF and DKIM are the baseline; DMARC and BIMI strengthen trust and branding.

| Authentication | Requires Setup | Purpose |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------- |
| SPF            | No             | Proves you are allowed to send from this domain |
| DKIM           | No             | Proves your email originated from you |
| DMARC          | Yes            | Proves you own the domain and instructs how to handle spoofs |
| BIMI           | Yes            | Proves you are the brand you say you are |

Action items:
1. Set up DMARC for your domain.
2. Set up BIMI for your domain.

## Legitimize Your Domain

Gmail evaluates your domain to understand who you are. Align your sending domain with your website and ensure your domain isn’t flagged as unsafe.

Action items:
1. Host your website at the same domain you send from (especially for new domains).
2. Regularly check if your domain is listed as unsafe with Google Safe Browsing.

## Manage Your Mailing List

Gmail uses recipient engagement (opens, clicks, replies) to gauge whether people want your emails. Focus on consented, active recipients and remove risky addresses. Tracking pixels/links can sometimes hurt placement; prioritize list quality.

Prevent sending to recipients who:
- Didn’t ask to be sent to (no opt-in).
- Show no signs of engagement with your emails or product.
- Requested to be unsubscribed.
- Marked your emails as spam (complained).
- Never received your email (bounced).

Action items:
1. Make it easy to opt out (include Unsubscribe headers).
2. Use webhooks to remove bounced or complained recipients from your list.
3. Use Gmail’s Postmaster Tool to monitor spam reports.

## Monitor Affiliate Marketers

Affiliates can help growth, but spammy affiliates can damage your sender reputation. If your brand is associated with spam, your other messages may be filtered.

Action item:
1. Regularly audit affiliates and remove any that send spam.

## Make Content People Want to Read

Build trust in the message itself. Keep emails simple, honest, and aligned with your brand and domain.

Guidelines:
- Less is more — keep copy focused and clear.
- Prefer plain text over complex HTML where possible.
- Make links visible and use your sending domain.
- Avoid hidden or manipulative content.

Action items:
1. Reduce and simplify email content.
2. Ensure links use and reflect your sending domain.

## Establish Sending Patterns

New domains lack history, so start small and warm up gradually. Segment by use case so Gmail can route appropriately (Primary, Promotions, etc.).

Address examples:
- Personal emails: `name@domain.com` (e.g., marissa@domain.com)
- Transactional emails: `notifications@domain.com`
- Marketing emails: `updates@domain.com`

Action items:
1. Send regular person-to-person emails from your Gmail account before bulk sending.
2. Send transactional emails before marketing emails.
3. Use dedicated sending addresses for each email type.

## Summary

Think: what would a phisher do? Then do the opposite. Prove legitimacy at every step — authenticate, align domains, respect consent, monitor affiliates, send valuable content, and ramp volume gradually. This is how you earn and keep the inbox.
